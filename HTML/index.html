            Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments,
            from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans
            (e.g., cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean. With 34,300 described species,
            fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.</p>

        <h2>Saltwater fish</h2>
        <p>Saltwater fish, also called marine fish, are fish that live in ocean water. Saltwater fish can
            swim and live alone or in a large group called a school. Saltwater fish are very commonly kept
            in aquariums for entertainment. Many saltwater fish are also caught to be eaten.</p>
        <p>Let's consider saltwater fish by the following criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Diet</li>
            <li>Captivity</li>
            <li>Habitats</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Fishes that live in the ocean can be carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores. Herbivores in the ocean
            eat things such as algae and flowering seagrasses. Many herbivores' diets consist of primarily algae.
            Most saltwater fish will eat both macroalgae and microalgae. Many fish eat red, green, brown, and blue algae,
            but some fish prefer certain types. Most saltwater fish that are carnivores will never eat algae under any circumstances.
            Carnivores' diets consist of shrimp, plankton, or tiny crustaceans.</p>
        <h3>Captivity</h3>
        <p>
            Saltwater aquariums are a multi-million dollar industry in the United States.
            About 10 million marine fish are imported into the United States each year for aquarium use.
            The United States imports more saltwater fish than any other country in the world.
            There are approximately 2,000 different species of saltwater fish that are imported and used in captivity.
            In many circumstances, fish used for marine trade are collected using harmful tactics such as cyanide.
            One way that people are trying to protect the coral reefs is by breeding marine fish in captivity.
            Captive-bred fish are known to be healthier and likely to live longer. Captive-bred fish are less susceptible
            to disease because they have not been exposed to the wild and they have not been damaged during the shipment process. Fish that are bred in captivity
            are already accustomed to aquarium habitats and food.</p>
        <h3>Habitats</h3>
        <p>
            There are many different components that make up a marine life habitat. Some of them are the temperature
            of the water, the quality, and quantity of water (flow and depth). Other components that can also contribute
            to the habitat of saltwater fish are pH level, salt level, and alkalinity level. There are other physical
            features that contribute to a habitat which are physical materials like rocks, reefs, and sand or the vegetation like the amount of algae, water plants,
            and saltmarsh. Specific fish live in specific habitats based on what they eat or what cycle of life they are currently at, another thing is the amount of salt that is in the water at that specific location.
            Another thing is that some ocean habitats aren't technically in the ocean and these are called estuaries,
            areas when oceans and rivers meet creating a mixture of salt water and freshwater making a different habitat
            for different types of fish and creatures to live in. The ocean is home to organisms as large as whales and
            as small as microscopic marine organisms such as phytoplankton. However, the vast majority of ocean life that
            humans are exposed to is simple saltwater fish. Saltwater fish can live in the deepest depths of the ocean
            where no sunlight can penetrate, but they can also live on the surface of the water.</p>

        <div>
        <h2>Freshwater fish</h2>
        <p>Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water,
            such as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 1.05%. These environments differ from marine
            conditions in many ways, the most obvious being the difference in levels of salinity. To survive fresh
            water, the fish need a range of physiological adaptations.</p>
        <p>Let's consider freshwater fish by the same criteria as saltwater fish:</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Many of the staple diets do a very good job of providing a broad range of essential nutrients required
            for good health. Variety in the diet is important to good nutrition and the well-being of your fish. Offering supplementary foods in addition to the 'staple'
            diet assures better nutrition, and enriches the diet of your fish with more tastes and textures.</p>
        <h3>Captivity</h3>
        <p>Wild-caught fish have been taken from their natural habitat, while captive-bred covers any fish bred in captivity, whether that be in a fish farm or a hobbyist fish tank. Some species are only available captive-bred, while others are
            notoriously hard to breed in captivity because their natural environments are hard to replicate in a tank. </p>
        <h3>Habitats</h3>
        <p>Freshwater fish habitats include:
            <ul>
                <li>habitat zones (rivers, lakes, wetlands, creeks, swamps etc.) in the upper, middle and lower sections of a waterway</li>
                <li>microhabitats within each of these zones including banks, snags, rocks, channels, substrates, riffles, macrophytes (aquatic plants) and riparian vegetation.</li>
                <li>Habitat zones influence the makeup of fish communities. This is particularly so in the headwaters of a catchment, where fish communities tend to be made up of fish species that specialise in living in the upper section of the waterway. Microhabitats have more influence on the distributions of individual fish species.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Freshwater fish, on the other hand, are subjected to a reverse effect. The salt levels inside their
            bodies are higher than the surrounding water outside because that water is constantly being drawn inward
            by the salt content in their system. Freshwater fish do not drink water as a result. If placed in a saltwater environment,
            they would literally drown in a sea of water because they are not geared to pull in extra water.</p>
